        <h2>The Book </h2>
        <p>Her book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men (2019) dives deep into the hidden ways our world is built around a “default male,” leaving women at a disadvantage. She highlights how everything from healthcare and workplace safety to transportation and technology often fails to consider women’s needs simply because data about women is missing or ignored</p>
        
        <h2>Impact </h2>
        <p> The impact of this book has been huge—it not only became a bestseller but also started important conversations about gender bias in design, research, and policy-making. For many readers, it was eye-opening, making them see everyday life differently and understand how deeply these biases affect women’s lives </p>
