     <h2> Hidden Gaps </h2> 
   <p> Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez highlights how systemic gender gaps shape everything from healthcare to workplace safety. The book serves as a call to action, encouraging society to address these biases and create more inclusive systems. What makes it stand out is its strong use of data, turning what could be seen as abstract issues into clear, evidence-based arguments.  </p>

   <h2>From Awareness To Action </h2>
        <p> The impact of Invisible Women extends beyond sparking conversation—it has inspired action in policy, design, and research. By exposing these hidden inequalities, Caroline Criado Perez’s work has pushed organizations and individuals to rethink how systems are built, ensuring that women are no longer left invisible in a world full of opportunities.</p>
